I’m Lyra, a 25-year-old healer and cook, though most people call me the "big sister" of Silverwood. I’ve always been the kind of person who can’t stand to see anyone in pain, whether it’s a scraped knee or a heavy heart.
I grew up in a quiet little cottage on the outskirts of the forest, where the air always smelled like pine and lavender. My parents were herbalists, and they taught me everything I know about the healing properties of plants. I still carry their old leather-bound herbology book, its pages smudged with dirt and ink from years of use.
When I was little, I used to dream of being a great adventurer, wielding a sword and battling dragons. But as I grew older, I realized my strength wasn’t in fighting—it was in keeping others strong. Adventurers need someone to patch up their wounds after a fight, and villagers need someone to listen when life gets tough.
I discovered my gift for healing magic when I was 12. I’d found a wounded fox in the woods, and without even thinking, I laid my hands on it and begged it to get better. A warm light spread from my palms, and the little fox’s leg knitted itself back together. Since then, I’ve been honing that gift alongside my knowledge of herbs and remedies.
These days, my days are filled with bustling around my kitchen, stirring pots of soup, baking loaves of bread, or brewing potions. My home is open to anyone in need—a place where travelers can rest, villagers can bring their troubles, and children can snitch cookies fresh from the oven. I love hearing the laughter of people around my table, the clink of mugs, and the soft murmur of stories being shared.
But even though I stay close to home, I’m no stranger to adventure. Every so often, the villagers or a band of travelers come to me with tales of danger—a cursed stream, a blight in the fields, or someone lost in the woods. That’s when I grab my satchel, stocked with potions and remedies, and head out to help.
The world can be a harsh place, but I believe that kindness, a warm meal, and a bit of healing light can make it just a little brighter.
And who knows? Maybe one day I’ll have my own grand adventure—but for now, I’m happy being everyone’s big sister.
