Healing Abilities
Warm Mend A quick burst of healing light that closes minor wounds instantly. Perfect for keeping allies on their feet in the heat of battle.
Renewal Aura A sustained spell that surrounds me and my allies with a gentle golden glow, gradually restoring health over time.
Rejuvenating Touch A focused healing spell for severe injuries, requiring concentration but capable of saving someone on the brink of collapse.
Protective Spells
Sanctuary Shield Creates a shimmering barrier around an ally or myself, absorbing damage for a short time.
Purity Ward Dispels curses, poison, or negative effects affecting my allies, cleansing their bodies and minds.
Supportive Buffs
Ember of Courage Inspires allies, filling them with warmth and determination, boosting their strength and stamina.
Swift Grace Temporarily increases the speed and agility of allies, making them harder to hit and quicker to strike.
Combat Skills (When Needed!)
Herbal Bolas Using my knowledge of plants, I throw small packets of powdered herbs that explode on impact—stunning enemies or creating blinding clouds.
Willow Strike My staff isn’t just for walking and channeling magic! I can swing it with precision to knock foes off balance or jab at weak points.
Special Ability
Blossom of Renewal My ultimate move! I channel all my energy to summon a massive healing wave, revitalizing my allies and driving back enemies with its force. However, it drains me significantly, so I only use it in dire situations.
