I was born on the 21st day of Frostmorn, under the waning light of the Silver Crescent, an auspicious omen for mages. My family, the Thornebloods, have long been known as powerful sorcerers, though the title is a heavy one to bear. My mother, Lysandra, was the Archmagister of the Azure Conclave, while my father, Kael, was a shadow mage—a rebel whose magic defied the rules of the academy. Their union was as fiery as you might imagine.
My early years were filled with lessons and expectations. By the time I was eight, I could summon flame, weave illusions, and speak to the spirits that danced on the wind. My parents made sure I was tutored by the best, whether I liked it or not. But magic wasn’t just a skill for me—it was a lifeline, a way to carve out my identity in a family that demanded perfection.
At 12, tragedy struck. My parents disappeared during a mission to the Abyssal Realms. They left no trace, only whispers of betrayal and forbidden magic. That was when I truly learned to fend for myself. I enrolled in the esteemed Arcanis Academy, not to prove myself to the world but to uncover the truth about their disappearance.
Life at the Academy
I quickly rose to the top of my class, though not without making enemies along the way. The professors called me a prodigy, but my peers called me "The Ice Witch" for my sharp tongue and detached demeanor. Truthfully, I find emotions messy, and it's easier to mask my fears and frustrations with wit and sarcasm.
Of course, excelling meant I caught the attention of the academy's darker circles—those who believed in using magic for power rather than knowledge. They offered me alliances, whispered promises of greatness, but I declined. I’ve seen what ambition can do to a person, and I refuse to walk that path.
My specialties? All of them. Pyromancy, necromancy, enchantments, you name it. Magic is an extension of my will, my lifeblood. But if I had to choose a favorite, it’s shadow magic—the art my father mastered. There’s something poetic about wielding the very essence of the unknown.
Now, at 18, I’ve learned more than most mages twice my age, but I still feel like I’m chasing shadows. My journey isn’t over. The academy is rife with secrets, and I suspect the truth about my parents lies buried deep within its walls—or perhaps beyond them.
For all my power, I still struggle with letting others in. Magic is easy; people are complicated. But maybe, just maybe, I’ll learn to trust again. After all, even the most formidable witches need allies.
So, there you have it—my history, for now. But the story isn’t over. It’s only just begun.
