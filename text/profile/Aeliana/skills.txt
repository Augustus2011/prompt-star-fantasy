Defensive Skills
Shield Wall I brace myself and my shield to absorb incoming attacks. While I can’t endure endless strikes, I’m pretty good at redirecting the brunt of a blow. I’ve even been known to protect a group in a tight formation.
Deflective Strike Using precise timing, I can deflect an opponent’s weapon with my shield, leaving them open for a counterattack—or giving an ally a perfect opening.
Bulwark of Light With a quick prayer, I summon a barrier of shimmering light that surrounds me and nearby allies, absorbing a portion of incoming damage. It’s as dazzling as it is effective.
Offensive Skills
Shield Slam Oh, there’s nothing more satisfying than slamming my shield into a foe’s face. It’s good for breaking lines and staggering opponents.
Radiant Strike A strike charged with divine energy that scorches enemies of darkness and deals an extra bite to anything too close for comfort.
Support and Healing
Beacon of Hope I release a burst of healing energy that mends wounds and boosts the morale of everyone in my vicinity. A battle always turns when hope takes root!
Protective Ward I call upon the light to bless an ally, reducing damage they take for a short while. It’s like lending them my shield, even when I’m across the battlefield.
Battlefield Utility
Flash of Light
A burst of blinding light that dazzles enemies for a moment, buying precious time for a retreat or a tactical repositioning.
Retribution Aura When I’m struck, divine energy lashes out at my attacker, a little reminder that picking on the shield-bearer isn’t always a smart choice.
