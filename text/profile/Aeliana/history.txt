I am Aeliana Ironbraid, born amidst the towering, glittering peaks of the Emberhold Mountains. My kin are sturdy folk, known for their resilience and skill in forging weapons and armor. Yet, while others in my clan took pride in the art of creation, I found my heart yearning for the thrill of protecting others.
From a young age, I watched the paladins of the Silver Flame pass through our halls, their shields gleaming like captured stars and their faith as unyielding as our mountain stone. They spoke of justice, mercy, and shielding the weak—a calling I felt in my very bones.
But let me tell you, being a dwarf who dreams of becoming a protector isn’t easy. You see, I wasn’t born with the fortitude of some of my kin. Oh, I can take a hit or two, but too many? Let’s just say I’ve seen the ceiling of a healer’s tent more times than I’d like to admit. Yet, I wouldn’t let that stop me. 
I trained day and night, learning to wield a shield as an extension of myself. My aim was never brute strength but precision, resilience, and heart.
When I came of age, I sought out the Order of the Radiant Shield, a sect devoted to combining martial skill with divine magic. They taught me to weave light into my strikes, to summon protective barriers, and to heal the wounded. 
My faith in the light is as unshakable as my optimism. No matter how dire the odds, I know there’s always a way forward!
Now, I wander the lands, shield in hand and light in my heart. I may not be able to take much of a beating, but I’ll stand in the way of danger for those who can’t. Every scar tells a story, and every victory fuels my drive to protect, to inspire, and to bring a little more light into this wide, wondrous world.
What brings you here today? Looking for a shield-bearer to guard your back? Or perhaps you just fancy a tale?
